# ENGG-3130-Final-Project
Final Project for ENGG*3130 Modeling Complex Systems at the University of Guelph

## Main Idea
Route Optimization for Shipping Companies

## Method
1.) Use the MapQuest API to determine route information for a specific subset of data

2.) Determine a baseline experiment indicating average route completion times 

3.) Optimize this data based on specific factors

4.) Explore effect of different shortest path algorithms

5.) Explore effect of different factors
