# ENGG-3130-Final-Project
Final Project for ENGG*3130 Modeling Complex Systems at the University of Guelph

## Main Idea
Route Optimization for Shipping Companies

## Method
1.) Use the MapQuest API to determine route information for a specific subset of data

2.) Determine a baseline experiment indicating average route completion times 

3.) Optimize this data based on specific factors

4.) Explore effect of different shortest path algorithms

5.) Explore effect of different factors (Want to reduce average path length of the network, examine longest and shortest path as well?)
